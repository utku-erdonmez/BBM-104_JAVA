# Projects
#### Programming Assignment *1*: Gym Meal Machine (GMM) Firmware
This project involves developing the firmware for the Gym Meal Machine (GMM) using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The GMM is designed to help users select and manage their gym meals efficiently.

#### Project Assignment 2: Bus Seat Management System
This system manages bus seats by providing functionalities such as creating and canceling bus voyages, selling and refunding available seats, and viewing voyage details.

#### Project Assignment 3: HU-Load Game
This project entails designing the User Interface (UI) and developing a game using the JavaFX library in Java. The game, named HU-Load, involves engaging gameplay mechanics and a visually appealing interface.

#### Project Assignment 4: Road Network Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of road networks using advanced algorithms. By implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, the project finds the shortest paths between various points, optimizing travel routes for efficiency. Additionally, Kruskal's algorithm is used to create a minimally connected map, ensuring no cycles exist in the network. The project includes a detailed comparison between the original road network and the optimized one, evaluating improvements in travel efficiency and reductions in construction material usage. This analysis aims to propose more efficient and cost-effective road network designs.
